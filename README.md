## üß© Project Workflow: Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Acquired IPL match and player data from Kaggle or other cricket data repositories.
- Combined datasets including:
  - Match-level details (venue, teams, toss, winner, etc.)
  - Player statistics (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy, etc.)

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Cleaned and standardized columns in Power Query Editor.
- Removed null values, fixed inconsistent team/player names.
- Created relationships between tables:
  - Matches ‚Üî Players
  - Matches ‚Üî Deliveries (ball-by-ball data)

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Built a star schema model using:
  - Fact tables: Matches, Deliveries
  - Dimension tables: Teams, Players, Seasons
- Defined relationships with appropriate cardinality and cross-filter direction.
- Created DAX measures for:
  - Total runs, wickets, strike rate
  - Win percentage, average scores, boundaries

### 4. **Dashboard Design**
Designed a multi-page interactive dashboard with:
- **Page 1**: Overview ‚Äì Season summary, total matches, champions
- **Page 2**: Team Performance ‚Äì Wins, toss decisions, venue stats
- **Page 3**: Player Stats ‚Äì Orange Cap, Purple Cap, best strike rates
- **Page 4**: Match Insights ‚Äì Toss impact, margin of victory, trends
- **Page 5**: Comparisons ‚Äì Team head-to-head stats

### 5. **Visualization Tools Used**
- Bar Charts, Line Charts, Pie Charts
- Slicers and filters for interactivity
- KPI Cards and custom visuals
- Drill-through for match and player deep-dives

### 6. **Insights Derived**
- Teams that win the toss and choose to bowl first often have higher win rates.
- Certain players consistently perform across seasons (e.g., top run scorers).
- Venues like Wankhede favor high scores; others are more bowling-friendly.
- Teams with stable captains and top-order strength dominate more matches.
